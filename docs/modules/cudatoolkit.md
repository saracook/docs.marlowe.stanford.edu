This module does the exact same things as [nvhpc](./nvhpc.md) and nvhpc is the preferred method of using CUDA. The only difference is that the Cuda Toolkit module also sets the `CUDA_HOME` directory.

The Cuda Toolkit module is only updated when `nvhpc` is updated.

To load Cuda Toolkit, run the following:

```
module load cudatoolkit
```
