Marlowe has multiple software packages pre-installed and available for use. 

Most are installed as modules and can be listed by running `module avail` in your terminal

The only modules loaded by default are `slurm` and `gcc/13.1.0`. If you need other module automatically loaded, it is recommended to add `module load <modulename>` to your `~/.bashrc` file.
